Code files of my rinky-dink web browser for sharing with LASP members. 

Contained here are the source code files of a very rudementary web browser I designed a while back as an excersize in networking with Java. At best, this browser will pull only the plain text of a webpage entered into its URL bar and display it. Due to the limited nature of this browser's design, only websites which are set up to communicate with so few checks and requests as I offer will deliver visible results; this excludes my browser from being able to navigate to most large websites like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. However, there is great joy to be taken in exploring those sites that will provide content. Navigate to stackoverflow.com and watch the title bar proudly present "Stack Overflow," visit my old computer science department's page at cs.okstate.edu and notice "CS Home" written just as it exists on the real webpage. All very uneventful, but wonderfully satisfying because it is 100% my code out there chatting it up with the cyber realm. What fun.
